# mini-raytracing

Minimum ray tracer implementing ray-sphere intersection.

While ray-sphere intersection detection is simple, it gets a little bit more diffcult to detect intersection between ray and polygon(for example triangle). Matrix determinant's power is lend to solve the problem above.

Usually Ray-Tracing is slower than raserization because it needs spwan numerous shadow rays from intersection point to simulate how ray transports. Correspondingly the renderin result is more photo-realism.
